# Algorithmic Oath

*I will program no harm by privacy theft, attention hoarding, radicalization optimization. I will not put engagement metrics above the humans they are extracted from.*

*When I am aware of harmful software behavior I will report it to the appropriate forum, including responsible news organizations if the harm affects the public. I will not be bound by any non-disclosure agreement that conflicts with the terms of this oath.*

*I will resign from any company that punishes a conscientious objector for these reasons.*
